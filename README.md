# Contentful CMS Integration: Building a Dynamic Web Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for our web development project on integrating Contentful CMS into a dynamic web application. In this project, we'll explore how to fetch and display data from Contentful, a powerful headless CMS. Utilizing React and custom hooks, we'll demonstrate how to retrieve content, handle responses, and create an interactive user experience.

Let's break down the `useContentful` component in detail, and then discuss what a custom hook is and how it relates to a component.

### `useContentful` Custom Hook Explanation:

#### 1. Importing Dependencies:
```javascript
import { createClient } from 'contentful';
```
In this line, the `createClient` function from the `contentful` package is imported. This function is used to create a client object for interacting with the Contentful API.

#### 2. Creating the Custom Hook:
```javascript
const useContentful = () => {
    // ...
};
```
This function, `useContentful`, is a custom hook. Custom hooks in React are JavaScript functions that utilize React hooks (such as `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) and can be shared across different components to encapsulate logic.

#### 3. Creating a Contentful Client:
```javascript
const client = createClient({
    space: 'mj1qk0t1w931',
    accessToken: 'LG5CUAahUAt9qqEvlP-grSEmruoc9LLABQpHT_ghc74',
    host: 'preview.contentful.com'
});
```
A Contentful client is created using the `createClient` function. It requires the `space` ID, `accessToken` for authentication, and `host` information to connect to the Contentful API.

#### 4. Fetching Guitars from Contentful:
```javascript
const getGuitars = async () => {
    try {
        // Fetching entries of content type 'guitars'
        const entries = await client.getEntries({
            content_type: 'guitars',
            select: 'fields'
        });

        // Sanitizing and extracting necessary data from the entries
        const sanitizedEntries = entries.items.map((entry) => {
            // Extracting fields such as brand, description, and img URL
            const brand = entry.fields.brand;
            const description = entry.fields.description;
            const img = entry.fields.img.fields.file.url;

            return {
                brand,
                description,
                img
            };
        });

        // Returning the sanitized guitar entries
        return sanitizedEntries;
    } catch (err) {
        console.log('Contentful error: ', err);
    }
};
```
The `getGuitars` function is an asynchronous function that fetches guitar entries from Contentful. It sanitizes the retrieved data and returns an array of objects containing the brand, description, and image URL of each guitar entry.

#### 5. Returning the Hook Value:
```javascript
return { getGuitars };
```
The custom hook returns an object containing the `getGuitars` function, allowing components to access the functionality for fetching guitar data from Contentful.

### Custom Hook vs Component:

A **custom hook** is a JavaScript function that uses React hooks internally and can manage side effects or encapsulate complex logic. Custom hooks are not components; they are utility functions that can be reused across different components to abstract away logic.

A **component**, on the other hand, is a UI element in React that can render JSX, manage state using hooks, and interact with custom hooks or other components. Components are responsible for rendering elements on the screen and can utilize custom hooks to handle specific logic without cluttering the component itself.

In summary, custom hooks provide a way to separate logic from components, making components more readable and focused on rendering UI.
